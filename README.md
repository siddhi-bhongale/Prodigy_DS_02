Prodigy InfoTech Internship – Task 2: Data Cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
As part of my internship at Prodigy InfoTech, Task 2 involved performing data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of choice, for which I used the Titanic dataset from Kaggle.

Overview
I cleaned and analyzed the Titanic dataset to uncover hidden patterns and relationships between key variables such as passenger class, age, gender, and survival status. This helped in understanding trends and preparing the data for further modeling tasks.

Skills Gained
Data cleaning and preprocessing using Pandas
Exploratory data analysis using Seaborn and Matplotlib
Understanding variable relationships and visualizing data trends
Gaining insights from real-world datasets
Sample Dataset: Titanic Dataset – Kaggle
